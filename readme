WATCHMAN UK PMT Performance Testing 

Repository for Watchman-PMT data taking, processing and analysis framework.

Email issues and suggestions to:
 gary.smith@ed.ac.uk

Instructions:
( tested on Mac OS 10.13.6, 10.15.7, CentOS7, Scientific Linux 7.6, Ubuntu )

1) Access the Code. Clone this repository on your local machine 
(Fork if planning to contribute). 

2) Set up the environment. Modify and execute the following lines 
  ( recommended to add them to your .bashrc file ) :

$ export WM_PARENT=/my/path/to/repository/parent/folder/
$ source ${WM_PARENT}/Wavedump_Wrapper/WM.sh

Now several environment variables have been set. The environment variables 
generally start with 'WM_'. For example try:

$ clear ; echo $WM_CODE; echo ' '; ls -lrth $WM_CODE ; echo ' ';

3) Build all the binaries
  ( requires root to be installed and its usual environment set ). 
$ cd $WM_CODE 
$ ./making.sh

4) Run file conversion and basic analysis to generate the analysis files and folders in the local directory. 

Have a read through $WM_CODE/Scripts/process_analyse_locally_auto.sh

NB the cooking stage requires either

A) the user to input meta data, OR

B) the data files are stored in a specific folder naming scheme 
/RUN000XXX containing a run number (e.g. XXX=001), 
/PMT0YYY containing the PMT number (e.g YYY=005) with the leading 0 required, 
/TestName beginning with e.g. D (Dark Rate), N (Nominal), S (SPE) or G (Gain),
and the channel number in the file name: e.g 
/wave_0.dat for DAQ channel 0 (underscore required)

Example using file /my/path/to/parent/data/folder/RUN000001/PMT0130/Nominal/wave_0.dat
$ cd /my/path/to/parent/data/folder/RUN000001/PMT0130/Nominal/
$ source process_analyse_locally_auto.sh 

Known issues:
The charge spectrum fits dont compile on Mac OS X but have been found to compile on linux
