Wavedump wrapper for TPB testing @ UoM
10/11/2023

A highly modified version of WATCHMAN's Wavedump_Wrapper used here at UoM.

Please be aware that these instructions most likely no longer work, but are still included for your benefit.
Instructions from the original repo:
( tested on Mac OS 10.13.6, 10.15.7, CentOS7, Scientific Linux 7.6, Ubuntu )

1) Access the Code. Clone this repository on your local machine.

2) Set up the environment. Modify and execute the following lines 
  ( recommended to add them to your .bashrc file ) :

$ export WD_DIR=/my/path/to/repository/parent/folder/
$ source ${WD_DIR}init.sh

Now several environment variables have been set. The environment variables 
generally start with 'WD_'. For example try:

$ clear ; echo $WD_SCRIPTS; echo ' '; ls -lrth $WD_SCRIPTS ; echo ' ';

3) Build all the binaries
  ( requires root to be installed and its usual environment set ). 
$ cd $WD_DIR 
$ ./build.sh

4) Run file conversion and basic analysis to generate the analysis files and folders in the local directory.

Have a read through $WD_PROCESS/process_analyse_locally_auto.sh

Cooking is not currently integrated in this system due to no input metadata or folder naming scheme

HOW TO RUN THE BASIC ACQUISITION SETUP:

DAQ process

- TURN OFF LIGHT/TURN ON PMT
- ENSURE TRIGGER IS AS DESIRED (STATE 3 ON THE LED GENERATOR)
- NAVIGATE TO $WD_ACQ
- RUN THE RELEVANT WAVEDUMP SCRIPT (source run_wavedump_500s.sh)
This will generate the relevant .dat files from the PMT output.

- MOVE THESE DATAFILES TO THE RELATIVE DIRECTORY WITH (source move_dat.sh). It will ask for a run directory, start with 000001, 000002, etc.

- This data will now be stored in $WD_STORAGE, under whatever folder direction it was given in move_dat.sh. Use parse_dat_root.py convert into a charge histogram.
